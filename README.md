# :sparkles: SimpleToast

Simple toast notification library with Tailwind CSS.

**This means TailwindCSS is required! for this to work "out of the box"**

Please note this may bug a bit on mobile

## :arrow_heading_down: Installation

Simply include the [SimpleToast.js](./SimpleToast.js) or [SimpleToast.min.js](./SimpleToast.min.js).

## :memo: Change Log

- 25th August rewrote some of the code and made it easier to customize, Also code is now smaller. - [#1](https://github.com/itaypanda/SimpleToast/issues/1)

## :gear: Config

No configuration is required unless you count the init and the toast itself.

## :fire: Usage

```javascript

// Init the library, can be skipped if you add:
// <div class="absolute bottom-0 right-0"></div>
// Anywhere in the page, recommended at the top or bottom
toastInit();

// Example info toast:

toast('Title', 'Message', toastStyles.info);

// Example warn toast:

toast('Title', 'Message', toastStyles.warn);

// Example error toast:

toast('Title', 'Message', toastStyles.error);

// Example success toast:

toast('Title', 'Message', toastStyles.success);


// Example toast with set fade time instead of the default (7.5 seconds):

toast('Title', 'Message', toastStyles.info, 10);

```

## :wrench: Adding custom styles

```javascript
const myCustomStyle = {
  color: "blue", // Tailwind CSS color. Ex: [#ffffff].
  icon: "<svg></svg>" // Doesn't have to be an svg.
};
```
